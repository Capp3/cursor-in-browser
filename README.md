# cursor-in-browser
## Deploy and use **Cursor - The AI Code Editor** directly in a **web browser**!

This work have been **strongly** influenced by the following repo: https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-remote

All versions of Cursor for x64 and arm64 architectures from **0.47.7** to **1.7.52** are now available !

**Cursor** versions with all required files are available under **cursor_versions** folder. The Dockerfile and Dockerfile.arm64 on the root directory are related to the latest version (**1.7.52**).

You can use **Github Docker repo** (ghcr.io) or **Docker Hub** to download the image, if you prefer to rebuild the image you may also clone the repo and build the image yourself.

### **• Maintained by:**

L'Arfo (arfo_dublo@boards.digital)⁠

### **• Where to get the image:**

https://hub.docker.com/r/arfodublo/cursor-in-browser

### **• Quick run :** 

Using **Docker Hub** :

```
docker run -d \
      -v your_path_to/cursor:/cursor \
      -v your_path_to/config:/config \
      -p 8050:8080 \
      -e CUSTOM_USER=cursor_user \
      -e PASSWORD=cursor_password \
arfodublo/cursor-in-browser:latest-x64
```

Using **Github (ghcr.io)** :

```
docker run -d \
      -v your_path_to/cursor:/cursor \
      -v your_path_to/config:/config \
      -p 8050:8080 \
      -e CUSTOM_USER=cursor_user \
      -e PASSWORD=cursor_password \
ghcr.io/arfodublo/cursor-in-browser:latest-x64
```

You can replace the **:latest-x64** tag (latest version for AMD processors) by the version and architecture you need (for example replace :latest-x64 by :latest-arm64 if working on ARM CPU or :1.2.3-x64 / :1.2.3-arm64 if you need a specific version).

### **• Important notes :**

1. Some buttons are not directly clickable in the UI. **Log in** button is part of those, to use these buttons you will need to copy the link (right click on them then copy) and open them in a new tab. Then follow the log in procedure on Cursor official web site in this **Log in** button example.

2. If you closed Cursor you will be redirected to a black screen. To reopen Cursor right click on this screen a menu will appear with Cursor icon and name. You can simply click on it to open it back.
